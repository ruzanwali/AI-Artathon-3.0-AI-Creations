# AI Artathon 2.0 | Stage 1
This is the first stage submission for AI Artathon 2.0

## Team Name:
AI Creations


## Team Members:
1. Ruzan Wali
2. Fatimah Mohammed
3. Ahmad Sami


## Project Name:
AI Reflections


## Project Brief Description:
The main idea of the "AI Creations": is to offer the community an interactive 3D and artistic environment that allows people to enjoy in a different and attractive way at art museums, concerts, summits, international competitions, and so on.
Visitors are greeted by a screen that acts as a mirror, reflecting a synthetic form that copies their movement and evolves to present using AI and ML techniques.
Project team: Ruzan Wali (AI Expert), Fatimah Mohammed (Artist) Ahmad Sami (AI Expert).


## Project AI Description:
The project is completely AI-based, it detects the human body movements by using Numby module and OpenCV library, and mirrors or reflects these movements as copies to the 3D object.


## Project Art Description:
The interactive AI art in this project is how the 3D object can be moved using the movements of the human body and its reflection on the 3D object, and how we can change from the fixed shape of the 3D object to another moving shape that differs from the original shape.


## Project Technologies Description:
ML libraries/modules:
* Numpy module: to know the dimensions of the body and 3D object (height, width, depth).
* OpenCV library: to recognize the human body parts.
* Mediapipe module: for building multimodal between video, image, and audio.
* time Library: to Adjusts video quality per second operations
* stackImages module: to combine photos or videos besides each other.
* pyOSC(Open Sound Control) module: to communicate between the human body movements and 3D object movements.
